GoalSetter App - Internship Assignment Documentation
Overview
The GoalSetter app is a productivity tool that helps users create, track, and manage their goals. 
The app allows users to set personal goals with titles, descriptions, and target dates. 
It also provides progress tracking through a time-based visual indicator (progress bar), and sends reminders to keep users on track with their goals.

Features Implemented
Goal Creation:
Users can create new goals by providing a title, description, and target date.
The goal details are stored locally using Firebase Firestore for persistence.

Progress Tracking:
A progress bar is displayed for each goal, where the progress is determined by the amount of time spent towards completing the goal.
The more time a user spends working on the goal, the more the progress bar fills, reflecting the goalâ€™s progression based on time elapsed relative to the target date.

Reminders:
Users receive local notifications to remind them about their upcoming deadlines or goals they are working towards.
Notifications are scheduled based on the target date of the goal.

UI/UX:
A clean and simple user interface is designed using Material Design components for consistency and ease of use.
The interface includes buttons, text inputs, and progress bars, ensuring smooth user interaction.

Challenges Faced
Increased Progress Bar with Target and Elapsed Time:
The challenge was to implement a progress bar that increased based on the target goal and elapsed time, while integrating with Firebase Firestore.
Solution: Using mathematical calculations, I was able to track the elapsed time compared to the target time and update the progress bar accordingly. This required careful handling of time-based data and Firestore synchronization.
